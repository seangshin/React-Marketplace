## Description
The motivation of this project is to build a MERN application that is a Content Management System (CMS) for an e-commerce site. It features a Sequelize ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to interact with a MySQL database. The application uses a React front end with Bootstrap to implement reactive components with a consistent, responsive, and scalable UI design. Payments can be accepted using the Stripe library with a built-in checkout page. It features libraries such as Multer for image upload handling and nodemailer to allow website emails for promotions and a better user experience. It also implements JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and authentication middleware to add several layers of security. All these technologies integrate together to give the ability to create a personalized user experience for an e-commerce website.
